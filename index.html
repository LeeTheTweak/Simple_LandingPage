                    Imagine being a mayor of a town or city where you can gather information 
                    on it's environment. Maybe the town needs work on it's public works, or maybe
                    it's vegetation. Or, maybe there needs to be a better solution for 
                    cleaner air in the area, and a better management for forest preserves.
                    ecoNET, provides a network that can store all of a town's ecosystem 
                    to make it easier to understand every aspect of it. Saving you time!
